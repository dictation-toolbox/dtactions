======================================
 Welcome to dtactions's documentation
======================================

The :code:`dtactions` project aims to provide functions that give information or perform actions on your Windows computer, that are in many cases not dependent on :code:`Dragon` or :code:`Natlink`.

For example:

- The :code:`sendkeys` function prints keystrokes to the screen.
- The :code:`monitorfunctions` provide information about the dimensions of your monitor(s) and can do actions on the placement of windows on your monitor(s)

Unimacro actions
================

The "Unimacro actions" that are used by :code:`unimacro`, but also by :code:`Vocola`, are now in this repository. These modules are located in the subdirectory :code:`unimacro` of this repository.



Note that quite a few things are still work in progress...
