natlinkclipboard
==============================================================================

The :code:`natlinkclipboard` module should offer easy access to and manipulation of
the Windows clipboard.

However, this module is not ready for use, as it corrupts the clipboard on Windows.

Please don't use it. You can turn to the functions in `dtactions/unimacro/unimacroutils.py` instead.
