2024//6/10: This directory was in the Unimacro repository, but is now put here, in dtactions.

The file "Unimacro.vch" holds the "USC-commands" ("Unimacro Shorthand Commands"), and the accompanying actions are also in this dtactions repository. So now, there remains no dependency between Vocola2 and Unimacro (as I am aware of).

For historic reasons though, the naming has been kept.
